    <div>This is like a normal page but without the cats.</div>
    <div>
        <p>What is 4chan?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>4chan is a simple image-based bulletin board where anyone can post comments and share images. There are
            boards dedicated to a variety of topics, from Japanese animation and culture to video games. However, this
            is Monica's page, not 4chan, so let's explain what Monica's page is about.</p>

    <div>
        <p>This page took about 9 hours to make. I want to say that it isn't hard, but I have lost a lot of practice
            this year. In the future, I plan to work on better projects.</p>
        <p>I want to dedicate this project to my girlfriend, whom I love so much. If anyone wants a drawing of her,
            please contact me at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nahumlopz_0.0/">nahumlopz_0</a>.</p>

        <p>One of her favorite games is *Rival Schools: United by Fate*, so Iâ€™m going to include it here.</p> <iframe
